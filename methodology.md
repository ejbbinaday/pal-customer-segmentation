# PAL Customer Segmentation — ML Pipeline Methodology

**Client:** Philippine Airlines (PAL)
**Version:** v0.4 — 11 May 2026

---

## Overview

This document describes the end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the PAL Customer Segmentation project. The objective is to produce a baseline segmentation model over PNR booking data, assigning each booking record to one of ten commercially meaningful customer segments. The pipeline combines rule-based proxy labelling, density-based clustering, penalty-weighted feature scaling, and direct nearest-centroid assignment for ambiguous records.

---

## Target Segments

The model targets ten segments:

| # | Segment | Penalty Weight |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Corporate | ×10 |
| 2 | Mabuhay Loyalist | ×8 |
| 3 | OFW/Migrant | ×5 |
| 4 | Premium Bleisure | ×4 |
| 5 | Pilgrimage | ×3 |
| 6 | Balikbayan/VFR | ×2 |
| 7 | Family | ×2 |
| 8 | Digital Nomad | ×2 |
| 9 | Last-Minute | ×1 |
| 10 | Budget/Adventure | ×1 |

Penalty weights reflect the business cost of misclassifying a record into the wrong segment. Higher-penalty segments (Corporate, Mabuhay Loyalist, OFW/Migrant) demand greater recall and drive the penalty-weighted feature scaling in Stage 5.

---

## Source Data

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| File | `sample-features.csv` |
| Rows | 29,999 |
| Columns | 27 |
| Target column | `Market Segment` — 100% null (no ground-truth labels exist) |

### Known Data Gaps (Blocking)

The following fields are present in the schema but contain no data in the current extract. Each gap limits one or more proxy segmentation signals:

| Feature | Limits |
|---------|--------|
| `Loyalty status` | Mabuhay Loyalist segment; strengthens Corporate and OFW proxy separation |
| `Length of stay` | Corporate vs. Leisure separation; Digital Nomad identification |
| `Departure Time` | Early-AM Corporate signal |
| `Cargo/baggage add-on` | OFW/Balikbayan confirmation signal |

Until these fields are populated from source systems, the Mabuhay Loyalist segment cannot be assigned via proxy labelling.

---

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1 — Data Ingestion & Cleaning

**Script:** `eda_graphs.py`

Load the raw extract and apply the following cleaning steps:

1. Load `sample-features.csv`.
2. Strip the `$` prefix from `Average Fare` and cast to `float`.
3. Parse `PNRCreationDate` and `Flight Date` as `datetime` with `dayfirst=True`.
4. Drop records where `PNRCreationDate` is null — **14 records removed (0.05%)**.

Post-cleaning row count: **29,985**.

---

### Stage 2 — Feature Engineering

**Script:** `eda_graphs.py`, `eda_segments.py`

Derived features are computed from the cleaned raw columns and appended to the feature matrix:

| Derived Feature | Definition |
|-----------------|------------|
| `lead_time` | `Flight Date` − `PNRCreationDate` (days) |
| `fare_per_pax` | `Average Fare` / `PAX Count` |
| `booking_month` | Month extracted from `PNRCreationDate` |
| `cabin_ord` | Ordinal encoding of Cabin: Y=0, W=1, J=2 |
| `is_dom` | Binary flag: 1 if Entity == `DOM`, else 0 |

Categorical encoding:

- **One-hot encoded:** Region, Farebrand, Itinerary Type, Ticketing Channel

Normalisation: all features are scaled with `StandardScaler` before clustering.

**Final feature matrix: 29,985 rows × 40 features.**

---

### Stage 3 — Proxy Label Assignment (Priority Waterfall)

**Script:** `eda_segments.py`

Because no ground-truth labels exist, a rule-based waterfall assigns proxy labels to create training seeds. Rules are applied in priority order; a higher-priority rule overwrites a lower-priority assignment if both match.

| Priority | Segment | Rule |
|----------|---------|------|
| 1 (lowest) | Budget/Adventure | Farebrand in {Economy Supersaver, Economy Saver} |
| 2 | Digital Nomad | PAX == 1 AND Region == ASEAN AND Channel in {WEB, APP} AND Farebrand in {Flex, Value} |
| 3 | Last-Minute | `lead_time` ≤ 3 days |
| 4 | Family | PAX Count between 3 and 5 |
| 5 | Pilgrimage | PAX Count ≥ 4 AND Channel == Traditional Travel Agency |
| 6 | Balikbayan/VFR | Itinerary Type == `Beyonds (INT - DOM)` |
| 7 | OFW/Migrant | Region == Middle East OR Channel == Sea Crew |
| 8 | Premium Bleisure | Cabin == W |
| 9 (highest) | Corporate | Cabin == J |

**Mabuhay Loyalist** has no active proxy rule due to the null `Loyalty status` field.

**Proxy label result:**

| Status | Count | Share |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Labelled | 22,907 | 76.4% |
| Unassigned | 7,084 | 23.6% |
| **Total** | **29,985** | **100%** |

**Note on resampling:** Five resampling strategies (Random Oversample, Undersample, SMOTE, ADASYN, Tomek Links) were evaluated and rejected. Proxy labels are derived from the same features used for classification, so F1 scores of 0.99+ reflect the model re-learning the labelling rules — not a generalisation signal. Class imbalance is handled downstream via the asymmetric penalty matrix in Stage 7.

---

### Stage 4 — Clustering Algorithm Evaluation

**Script:** `cluster_compare.py`

Seven algorithms were evaluated on the full 40-feature scaled matrix. The target was 10 interpretable clusters corresponding to the ten segments.

| Algorithm | Silhouette ↑ | Davies-Bouldin ↓ | Calinski-Harabasz ↑ | Clusters | Noise % |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| KMeans | 0.167 | 1.721 | 1,864 | 10 | 0.0% |
| MiniBatchKMeans | 0.136 | 1.976 | 1,668 | 10 | 0.0% |
| GMM | 0.114 | 2.004 | 1,559 | 10 | 0.0% |
| Agglomerative (Ward) | 0.151 | 1.765 | 1,835 | 10 | 0.0% |
| DBSCAN | 0.554 | 0.774 | 1,738 | 221 | 7.9% |
| **HDBSCAN** ★ | **0.435** | **0.961** | 1,554 | **78** | **7.1%** |
| Birch | 0.247 | 1.303 | 1,336 | 10 | 0.0% |

**Decision: HDBSCAN selected.** Rationale:

1. Does not assume spherical clusters — follows actual density contours in feature space.
2. Naturally identifies noise (7.1% ≈ 2,100 records) — genuine boundary cases that are resolved by nearest-centroid assignment rather than forced cluster membership.
3. 78 micro-clusters can be merged to 10 named segments via nearest-centroid mapping (Stage 6).
4. KMeans forces every borderline record into its nearest centroid, silently polluting proxy seeds. HDBSCAN flags them as noise instead, surfacing the ambiguity explicitly.

---

### Stage 5 — Penalty-Weighted Feature Scaling

**Script:** `hdbscan_final.py`

Before fitting HDBSCAN, features are re-scaled according to their discriminative power for high-penalty segments. This ensures that features critical to identifying Corporate or OFW/Migrant bookings carry proportionally greater weight in the HDBSCAN distance metric.

**Procedure:**

```
For each segment s with penalty weight p(s):
    Compute the segment centroid in StandardScaler space
    For each feature f:
        weight[f] += (p(s) / total_penalty) × |mean(f | segment == s)|

Normalise weight vector to mean = 1
Apply weights to scaled feature matrix before HDBSCAN fit
```

**Effect:** Features that strongly identify Corporate bookings (`cabin_ord`, TMC channel, short `lead_time`) and OFW/Migrant bookings (Middle East region, TTA channel, long `lead_time`) receive higher weight in the distance metric. This tightens the corresponding clusters and improves their separation from the high-volume Budget/Adventure mass.

---

### Stage 6 — Cluster → Segment Mapping & Noise Assignment

**Script:** `hdbscan_final.py`

HDBSCAN returns 78 micro-clusters plus a noise set (label = −1). This stage maps all records — micro-clusters and noise alike — to the ten named segments.

**Micro-cluster assignment:**

1. Compute the centroid of each HDBSCAN cluster in penalty-weighted feature space.
2. Compute the centroid of each proxy-labelled segment (from Stage 3) in the same space.
3. Assign each cluster to its nearest segment centroid by Euclidean distance.

**Noise record assignment:**

Records with label = −1 (~7.1% of the dataset) are automatically assigned to their nearest segment centroid using the same penalty-weighted feature space. This is consistent with the micro-cluster assignment logic and requires no human intervention. The penalty-weighted distance metric already biases the space so that high-stakes segments (Corporate, OFW/Migrant) pull nearby ambiguous records correctly.

**Result:** All 29,985 records receive a final segment label. No records remain unassigned.

---

### Stage 7 — Validate (Asymmetric Cost Matrix)

Final label quality is evaluated using the segment penalty matrix rather than standard accuracy or macro-F1.

**Metrics reported:**

| Metric | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Total weighted cost | Sum of `penalty_weight[true_segment]` for all misclassified records |
| Cost per record | Total weighted cost / total records |
| Per-segment recall | Recall computed separately for each of the ten segments |

**Optimisation target:** maximise recall for Corporate (×10) and OFW/Migrant (×5), the two segments where misclassification carries the highest business cost.

---

### Stage 8 — Dashboard (Power BI)

**Deliverable:** Executive Power BI dashboard at Origin & Destination (O&D) level, segmented by travel month.

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Filters/slicers | Segment, travel month, O&D pair |
| Segment mix | Share of bookings per segment per route |
| Average fare per segment | Fare distribution by segment |
| Lead time distribution | Booking horizon by segment |
| Route × segment heatmap | Cross-tabulation of route and segment volume |

## Current Limitations (Sample Data)

The current pipeline runs on a **29,999-row January 2025 snapshot**. Key constraints:

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| All flight dates are January 2025 only | Seasonality signals (Pilgrimage, Balikbayan, OFW deployment) cannot be validated on flight date |
| `Loyalty status`, `Departure Time`, `Length of stay` are 100% null | Mabuhay Loyalist has zero proxy-labelled records; Corporate and OFW proxy rules are weaker |
| No RFM history | Booking frequency and recency cannot be computed per passenger |
| No cargo/ancillary flags | OFW/Balikbayan confirmation signal is absent |

---

## Next Steps — Scaling to Full Historical Data

PAL holds **~6 million PNR records spanning 5 years**. The following actions are recommended in priority order.

### Immediate (Blocking)

| Action | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Request `Loyalty status` (Mabuhay Miles tier) from PAL | Unlocks Mabuhay Loyalist segment; strengthens Corporate and OFW proxy rules |
| Request flight schedule data | Provides `Departure Time` — early-AM Corporate signal |
| Request return PNR pairing | Derives `Length of stay` — short stay = Corporate, long stay = Leisure |
| Request ancillary / SSR data | Cargo add-on = OFW/Balikbayan signal; seat selection = Corporate |

### Short-Term (Data Preparation)

1. **Filter COVID years.** Exclude or flag 2020–2021 records — anomalous travel patterns will distort cluster positions. Recommended: exclude from training, retain for validation.
2. **Engineer RFM features per passenger** — `flights_last_12m`, `avg_fare_12m`, `routes_flown`, `recency_days`. These serve as the strongest proxy for Mabuhay Loyalist before loyalty data arrives.
3. **Add temporal segment features** — `is_holy_week`, `is_hajj_season`, `is_balikbayan_season`, `is_ofw_deployment_peak`, `travel_quarter`.
4. **Stratified sample for development.** Use 500K records (stratified by year, route region, cabin) for model iteration. Train on sample, predict on full 6M.

### Medium-Term (Pipeline Scaling)

| Component | Current | Recommended at 6M rows |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| Data loading | `pandas` | `polars` or chunked `pandas` |
| HDBSCAN | `min_cluster_size=150` | `min_cluster_size=500–1000`, `algorithm='prims_kdtree'` |
| Nearest-neighbour search | `sklearn` brute | FAISS approximate nearest neighbours |

### Full Retrain Sequence

```
[1] Receive 5-year dataset + blocking features from PAL
[2] Clean, engineer RFM + temporal features, filter COVID years
[3] Refit penalty-weighted StandardScaler on full dataset
[4] Refit HDBSCAN (min_cluster_size=500–1000)
[5] Re-run cluster → segment mapping + noise auto-assignment (Stage 6)
[6] Validate with asymmetric cost matrix (Stage 7)
[7] Build Power BI dashboard on final labelled dataset
[8] Define monthly refresh pipeline for production scoring
```

## Future Enhancements (When Blocking Data Arrives)

Once `Loyalty status`, `Cargo/baggage add-on`, `Length of stay`, and `Departure Time` are available from PAL systems, the proxy waterfall can be extended with exclusion rules that narrow segment assignments further. For example:

- A record booked 60+ days out in Economy with no loyalty ID is unlikely to be Corporate.
- A record with a cargo add-on on a Manila–Riyadh route is unlikely to be Premium Bleisure.
- A Business-cabin same-day return with loyalty status narrows to Corporate or Premium Bleisure only.

These rules are not implemented in the current pipeline because the required fields are 100% null in the sample dataset and would have no effect. They are documented here as a planned extension, not a current dependency.
